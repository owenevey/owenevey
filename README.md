# About

I’m a senior full stack engineer on the CenterWell Pharmacy mobile team at Humana. Previously, I’ve worked in a machine learning research lab, a particle accelerator research facility, and several Fortune 500 companies. I have a degree in computer science with a minor in Chinese from Michigan State.

Outside of programming, I love sports, fitness, music festivals, and exploring the outdoors.
